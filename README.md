## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Data Science & Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on cancer cells. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order:
1. [Data Extraction](https://github.com/lyxm58290/DSAI_CancerData/blob/main/Notebooks/DataExtraction.ipynb)
2. [Data Visualisation](https://github.com/lyxm58290/DSAI_CancerData/blob/main/Notebooks/DataVisualization.ipynb)
3. [Data Splitting/Classification](https://github.com/lyxm58290/DSAI_CancerData/blob/main/Notebooks/DataSplit_Class.ipynb)
4. [Random Forest Tree](https://github.com/lyxm58290/DSAI_CancerData/blob/main/Notebooks/RandomForest.ipynb)

## Problem Definition
* Are we able to utilise the traits and characteristics of a cancer cell to predict the nature of the tumour: Benign or Malignant?
* Which model would be the best to predict?

## Models Used
* Uni-Variate Decision Tree Classifier
* Multi-Variate Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier (with Cross-Validation)

## Conclusion
* Concavity, area and concave_points are good variables to predict whether a tumour is Benign (Good) or Malignant (Bad).
* Our findings underscore the importance of ongoing research and collaboration in leveraging data-driven approaches to combat this complex and multifaceted disease.
* Our model can serve as a valuable tool for initial screening or immediate assessment of tumour malignancy. 

## What did we learn from this project
* Teamwork makes the dream work
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* The use of Decision Tree Classifier
* The use of Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
* Enhance RFC with Cross-Validation Method
* Collaborating on GitHub
